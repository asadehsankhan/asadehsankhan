Hello my profile visitor, I am a Cybersecurity student who have previously worked with different roles such as HR/Admin, Amazon Station Support, and Technical and Customer Support. I have been a tech geek since childhood. I love tech gadgets, experimenting with softwares, trying different operating systems, and exploring security and privacy. Now I am fully focused on Cybersecurity. I code in my free time to strengthen my skills in pentesting system defense, and network security. 
Always curious. Always learning.
